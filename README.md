# PoorParticleSystem
C++ Based Single Header Particle system!

The basic idea is: Have one fixed Array of N particles and when they die Restart them!

Example: 
1000 spawned
START -> timeseps... -> all die -> reset the particles.

Just Include the ParticleSystem.h and have fun!

//Check main.cpp for one example implementation.


***TODO ->*** Reset individual particles as them die, instead of waiting for all of them to die to reset.
